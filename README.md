# Periodic table
This is a periodic table of elements. I am using some xml files (well quite a few actually). I am using JSON and [xmltodict](https://github.com/martinblech/xmltodict) to make my json "database". Jade and sass are used for markup and styles, while plain javascript is also used.

Right now my node_modules include:
- [browser-sync](https://github.com/BrowserSync/browser-sync)
- [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp)
- [gulp-jade](https://github.com/phated/gulp-jade)
- [gulp-rename](https://github.com/hparra/gulp-rename)
- [gulp-ruby-sass](https://github.com/sindresorhus/gulp-ruby-sass)
- [gulp-shell](https://github.com/sun-zheng-an/gulp-shell)


Todo:
- add charges ✔️
- UX design for frontend ✔️
